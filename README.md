Project Showcase: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering ðŸš€

In today's competitive market, understanding customer behavior and preferences is crucial for business growth. I tackled this challenge by implementing a customer segmentation model to uncover distinct customer groups within a dataset from a retail store.


Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle to tailor their marketing strategies to diverse customer needs, leading to ineffective promotions and lost revenue. My goal was to segment customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending scores to enable more targeted marketing efforts.


Approach & Solution

Using K-Means Clustering, a popular machine learning algorithm, I analyzed customer data to identify natural groupings. The dataset included key features such as CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. After pre-processing and exploratory data analysis, I determined that five clusters provided the optimal segmentation, as indicated by the elbow method.


Findings & Insights

The analysis revealed five distinct customer segments:

High Income, High Spending - Customers willing to spend more, perfect for premium offerings.
Low Income, Low Spending - Price-sensitive group, better targeted with budget-friendly options.
High Income, Low Spending - Potential for upselling through value-based promotions.
Low Income, High Spending - Seek quality despite lower income, good candidates for loyalty programs.
Moderate Income, Balanced Spending - A balanced group open to a variety of offerings.

Actionable Insights

Targeted Marketing: Tailor promotions to specific segments, such as premium products for high-income, high-spending customers.
Product Development: Introduce budget-friendly products for price-sensitive segments.
Customer Retention: Develop loyalty programs for high-spending customers regardless of income.
